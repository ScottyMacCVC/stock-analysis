# Actively Traded Stocks Return %

## We will explore the correlation between the daily volume of a stock and the % return.

### Our current process will look at 2017 & 2018 stock volume & return. We can extrapolate from the past whether there is, in fact, a correlation between the two measurements. And potentially use the information to give us direction on stock picks.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### 2017 fails to correlate stock volume & return. The largest volume, SPWR, produced a 23.1% return and the highest % return was DQ with 199.4%. But the issue is DQ has the lowest total daily volume in the set. Effectively, DQ proves the theory incorrect and we cannot correlate return % to total daily volume in 2017.

### 2018 fails to correlate stock volume & return. When you look at the two successful tickers, ENPH & RUN, there is some correlation between volume & return. ENPH hit 607,473,500 and hit 81.9% return. RUN hit 502,757,100 and hit 84.0% return. The challenge is SPWR has 538,024,300 daily volume, which is more than RUN, but RUN received a -44.6% return. If we were to use the daily volume theory here, we would be left holding the bill for the losses. We can say the same about FSLR. It would be a mistake to rely on Total Daily Volume as the key performance indicatior in 2018, therefore proving our theory incorrect again.
